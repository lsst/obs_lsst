        This method does not apply per-obsid corrections.  The following

        * On June 24th 2019 the detector was changed from ITL-3800C-098
          to ITL-3800C-068.  The header is intended to be correct in the
          future.
        * In late 2019 the DATE-OBS and MJD-OBS headers were reporting
          1970 dates.  To correct, the DATE/MJD headers are copied in to
          replace them and the -END headers are cleared.
        * Until November 2019 the IMGTYPE was set in the GROUPID header.
          The value is moved to IMGTYPE.
        * SHUTTIME is always forced to be `None`.

        Corrections are reported as debug level log messages.

        See `~astro_metadata_translator.fix_header` for details of the general
        process.
